## 8051 Fun with Kashouryo!
Goofing around with 8051(STC15F104W and STC15W408AS) 

## Targeted MCU
1. STC8F104W
2. STC15W408AS
3. Might include some AVR Arduino projects

## Compile by yourself!
Hex files are not provided. You'll need a properly licensed Keil C51 toolchain to compile these projects.
### But I use SDCC!(Open source gang!)
Me too. However, I am using Keil for most of these projects. Sorry! XD
